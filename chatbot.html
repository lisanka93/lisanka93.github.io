          <p>As part of my PhD project on “Development of Chatbot Technology for Acquiring and
Analysing Arguments” at University College London, we want to develop a chatbot as part
of a toolkit for acquiring and analysing views of people on a variety of topics. Consider for
example, in behaviour change, different people have different reasons for not eating a
healthy diet or for not undertaking exercise. The aim of the chatbot would be to discuss
these issues with different people in order to acquire data on the range of reasons. The
dialogues acquired by the chatbot will be useful data for designing interventions in
healthcare. In a sense, the chatbot will be an automated researcher for carrying out
surveys with users.</p>

            <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> What will happen if you take part </strong> </font>

            <p>Wou will engage in a dialogue with a chatbot about your opinion regarding COVID-19 vaccination. During the course of
the dialogue the chatbot will present you with arguments for getting a COVID-19 vaccine, should one be developed
and released to the public, to which you can reply with arguments that support your point of view. </p>

             <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Why have I been chosen?</strong> </font>
            <p>Recruitment happens via Prolific. If you are able to sign up for this study it means you
satisfy the inclusion criteria. You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to take part in
this research study. You are responsible for providing your real age on prolific. </p>


 <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Do I have to take part?</strong> </font>
<p>Taking part in the study is entirely voluntary and you can discontinue at any time without
giving a reason. Just stop replying to the chatbot and contact Lisa Chalaguine at
lisa.chalaguine.16@ucl.ac.uk telling her you are withdrawing from the experiment, and she
will delete your discussions from the database. You can contact us through prolific. It
should be noted that withdrawal requests will not be accepted after the 1st of September 2020.
If payment has not been made by the time the participant withdrew from the study, the
participant will not be paid for his or her participation. </p>

             <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Information you submit</strong> </font>
            <p>Neither in the MS Form, nor during the chat with the chatbot will you be asked for any
personal information, so please refrain from doing so. We also guarantee that we will not
use any content from your public facebook profile. No third parties have access to the
facebook application and its chats and at the end of the experiment, the application
including its chats will be deleted.
By taking part in the study you promise that any information you submit either in the MS
Form or to the chatbot is your honest, personal opinion. You grant us the permission to
read, analyse and potentially publish any information you provide.
You further agree that you shall not submit content in the MS Form or during the chat with
the chatbot that is</p>


            <ul>
            <li>obscene, vulgar, or pornographic </li>
            <li> amounts to spam </li>
            <li> is otherwise offensive or inappropriate by generally accepted standards </li>
            </ul>
  <p>Violation will lead to the participant being blocked from accessing the chatbot.  </p>


             <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Use of personal information</strong> </font>
            <p>No personal data of you is collected during the study. The first legal basis for processing
your data will be in the public interest. We shall securely store any information you supplyand may produce reports on the acquired data. These reports will be based on anonymous
data, which means that individuals will not be identified in the reports. The information is
stored locally on our server without the participants’ facebook names.
Given that the subject of the study is COVID-19 related, and the data we collect may
include medical information, the second legal basis is scientific and historical research or
statistical purpose. Analysing people’s arguments and the concerns they have about the
possible vaccine will help scientists and politicians to address those concerns. </p>
<p> Please refer to <a href='https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/ucl-general-privacy-notice-participants-and-researchers-health-and-care-research-studies'>here</a>
for more information how researchers like us at UCL use your data.</p>


             <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Payment</strong> </font>
            <p>You will be paid in pounds sterling via Prolific. The rate will be stated in the study details
on Prolific.</p>

            <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Advantages of Participation</strong> </font>
           <p>Expected benefits for participants are long term. If information acquisition could be
automated, it would allow policy makers to act faster on the concerned topic. Instead of
wasting time and resources identifying the reasons for the underlying problems, those
resources could be spend on developing appropriate responsive measures.</p>

           <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Possible Risks of Participation</strong> </font>
          <p>There may be a certain emotional risk related to reading and answering the chatbots arguments.
Participants might get defensive or irritated when having to argue their point of view on
vaccinations. However, the participant may choose not to respond and end the chat at any
time and withdraw from the study (see next paragraph).
Be aware that the cut-off date for withdrawing finished chats from the dataset is the 1st of
September 2020 as by then we will have made the corpus publicly available for further
research.</p>

          <FONT COLOR="FFFFFF"><strong> Raising a Complaint</strong> </font>
         <p>If something goes wrong or you wish to complain about any part of the research study
please contact Lisa Chalaguine at lisa.chalaguine.16@ucl.ac.uk.
If your complaint has not been handled to your satisfaction you can contact the Chair of
the UCL Research Ethics Committee at ethics@ucl.ac.uk.</p>
